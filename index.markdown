The [BrickMMO](http://brickmmo.com/) smart city built with LEGOÂ® bricks has many systems working together to build a live interactive city.

As the city grows we will integrate more and more systems into the smart city.

Each system will have:

- A set of repos to store different parts of the applications.
- Each system will also have an [About Site](https://github.com/BrickMMO/template-about-markdown) used to document the systems purpose, contributors, and progress.

You will not be building and coding the systems. This is only a brainstorming session. You will only be documenting your concept. The result of this hackathon is a PDF that will be used as a reference by another group of students in the future.

## Examples

The [BrickMMO Radio V1](https://brickmmo.github.io/radio-about/) has been developed. It has three repos:

- [radio-frontend-v1](https://github.com/BrickMMO/radio-frontend-v1)
- [radio-reporters-v1](https://github.com/BrickMMO/radio-reporters-v1)
- [radio-producers-v1](https://github.com/BrickMMO/radio-producers-v1)

All developed systems have an [About Site](https://github.com/BrickMMO/template-about-markdown):

- [Flow](https://brickmmo.github.io/flow-about/)
- [BrickMMO Radio](https://brickmmo.github.io/radio-about/)
- [GPS](https://brickmmo.github.io/gps-about/)

### Documentation

Each year we convert past hackathon PDFs to Markdown in the hopes that they will be programmed into the BrickMMO Smart City:

- [Power Grid](power-grid)

### Undocument Ideas

Some other possible ideas include:

- Google Maps
- Streetview
- Twitter

There are more undocumented ideas on the [Ideas Page](ideas).

## Steps

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Brainstorm a list of possible systems that could be added into BrickMMO.
2. From your list (or the undocumented list above) choose one system your group would like to conceptualize.
3. Brainstorm how your system will work:

   - How will your system work?
   - What other systems is your system dependant on?
   - What parts of your system can be controlled by an admin panel?
   - What does the front end of your system look like?

4. Brainstorm what assets your system will require (frontend, control panel, API).
5. Brainstorm which sensors, motors, and lights will be required to integrate the concept.

   > Checkout a list of available sensors and motors  
   > [https://brickmmo.github.io/media/sensors-motors](https://brickmmo.github.io/media/sensors-motors)

6. Write Block of [pseudocode](https://pseudocode.codeadam.ca) for your system.

7. Document this system using the Google Docs template.

   > You can download a copy of this template  
   > [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1huKFnm_8q7gQQFv6ynBVG4fm38fjTWHPU_v_qM_AWXI/](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1huKFnm_8q7gQQFv6ynBVG4fm38fjTWHPU_v_qM_AWXI/)

8. Add your document to the [hackathon-system](https://github.com/BrickMMO/hackathon-system/) repo. You can add your PDF document to the `results` folder.

   You will need to fork the repo, add your changes, and submit a pull request.

9. Adjust the [Ideas Page](ideas). Add your unused ideas to the Undocumented section. Add your chosen idea to the documented section with a link to your PDF.

> There are additional instructions available  
> [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Rq66r29iYRz-L_WGnZMtDgs98yHZ5PtIB3mdHTTChIg](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Rq66r29iYRz-L_WGnZMtDgs98yHZ5PtIB3mdHTTChIg)

## Submitting this Task

Once your instructor has merged your pull request, submit a link to your PDF to the **System Hackathon** assignment in [Blackboard](https://learn.humber.ca/).
